                <p> Hello! My name is Lucas Everson, and I am currently in my final year at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN.</p>
                <p> An Applied Statistics major and Computer / Information Science minor, I aspire to become deeply involved in the data analytics world.
                To accomplish this, I have gotten my start as a Data Analyst Intern at Utilimarc, a software company located in St. Louis Park, MN.
                I have been at the company for nearly a year, and am currently working towards earning a full-time position once I graduate
                in May 2022. </p> 
                <p> My prior real-world experience in data analytics has stemmed entirely from this internship. During my time there thus far, I have worked
                almost exclusively in the areas of data visualization and communication. Through my pulling of desired data from client databases using queries
                I write and edit using the SQL programming language, I am able to design various data visualizations with the specific purpose of
                answering questions clients pose to us regarding topics such as company efficiency and employee performance. As a result of this
                "big brother" style of exchange, clients I work with are better able to make more informed business decisions. </p>

                <p> Hello! My name is Nolan Jones, and I am majoring in Computer Science at the University of Saint
                Thomas. I have alreadyrecieved a minor in sustainablity which I hope, in the future, I will be able
                to apply to my field. I plan to get a job at Microsoft after I graduate. I also plan to go out 
				and travel to countries I have always wanted to visit around the world. And hopefully,
                if luck is on my side, I will be able to get a breed of dog I have always wanted: a corgi/husky mix.</p>

        <h2> Tools Used </h2>
            <h3><a href = "https://leafletjs.com/" target = "_blank"> Leaflet API </a></h3>
            <p> Open-source JavaScript library which focuses on creating and customizing interactive maps for users. Used by
                numerous big-name companies, such as GitHub, Facebook, The Washington Post, and Etsy. </p>

            <h3><a href = "https://nominatim.org/release-docs/latest/api/Overview/" target = "_blank"> Nominatim </a></h3>
            <p> Searches data from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) to
                convert a street address or location name into a coordinate location on a map, or translate a coordinate location 
                into a street address or location name. These processes are known as geocoding and reverse-geocoding,
                respectively. </p>

            <h3><a href = "https://vuejs.org/" target = "_blank"> Vue.JS </a></h3>
            <p> Open-source JavaScript framework that is among the most popular in the world, also known for its overall
                simplicity. Used by numerous big-name companies, such as Nintendo, Adobe, BMW, and Facebook. </p>

            <h3> Project 3 - RESTful Server </h3>
            <p> Uses SQLite3 to search a public dataset on crime in St. Paul and displays information based on what 
                the user is looking for (entered through the URL). Such information includes the type of crime committed,
                the neighborhood where it occurred, when it happened, and the approximate address of the crime. </p>

        <h2> Interesting Findings </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> According to our map, North End is the neighborhood with the most crimes (147 out of sample of 1000) and
                    Summit Hill is the neighborhood with the least (22 out of sample of 1000). </li>
                <li> Frogtown is obviously a funny name for a St. Paul neighborhood, and its origin dates as far back 
                    as the 1860s. Known originally as "Froschenburg" by the German-Bohemian settlers who first moved there, the area 
                    was characterized at the time by its numerous swamps and marshes (and therefore its high frog population). </li>
                <li> In terms of St. Paul as a whole, the University of St. Thomas is located in a very good area-- according 
                    to our map, the two neighborhoods it inhabits (Macalester - Groveland and Union Park) are among the least
                    crime-heavy neighborhoods in the city, with only 29 and 34 crimes (respectively) out of our sample of 1000. </li>
                <li> According to the city bounds established by our map, the University of Minnesota's St. Paul Campus technically
                    isn't located in St. Paul at all-- it's technically in Falcon Heights. </li>
                <li> According to our map, with the exceptions of the West End neighborhood and Pike Island in the southern
                    Highland neighborhood, the southern (and most of the eastern) city limits of St. Paul are entirely
                    defined by the Mississippi River. </li>
                <li> According to our map, the 3M headquarters are *almost* located in St. Paul, but are entirely found outside
                    of the St. Paul city limits. Very sad :( </li>
