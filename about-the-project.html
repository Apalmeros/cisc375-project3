            <p> Hello! My name is Lucas Everson, and I am currently in my final year at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul, MN.</p>
            <p> An Applied Statistics major and Computer / Information Science minor, I aspire to become deeply involved in the data analytics world.
                To accomplish this, I have gotten my start as a Data Analyst Intern at Utilimarc, a software company located in St. Louis Park, MN.
                I have been at the company for nearly a year, and am currently working towards earning a full-time position once I graduate
                in May 2022. </p> 
            <p> My prior real-world experience in data analytics has stemmed entirely from this internship. During my time there thus far, I have worked
                almost exclusively in the areas of data visualization and communication. Through my pulling of desired data from client databases using queries
                I write and edit using the SQL programming language, I am able to design various data visualizations with the specific purpose of
                answering questions clients pose to us regarding topics such as company efficiency and employee performance. As a result of this
                "big brother" style of exchange, clients I work with are better able to make more informed business decisions. </p>
